This project began as proof of concept to create a deck of cards in Java.

It was then expanded to the development of the card game 'Sh*thead'
(also known as Karma, Palace and Shed and decrived from the Finnish
game Paskahousu). The object of which is to lose all your cards, with
the final player losing. The game became popular among backpackers in
the late 20th century.

The next stage of the project will involve creating a multiplayer
experience through the use of servers and online play.
